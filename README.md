# cmsc723-projects

All projects are implemented using Python 2.7

## P1: word meaning disambiguation

We implemented a word meaning disambiguation system based on 1) naive bayes and 2) peceptron. Given a word in a sentence and a set of possible meanings, the system predicts the most possible meaning for the word.

Packages used: ntlk, sklearn, numpy

## P2: dependency parsing

We implemented a transition-based dependency parser (arc-standard). Given a sentence in the CoNLL format, it assigns the dependency relationship among words.

## P3: neural transliteration

This project aims to provide hands on experience with neural models for NLP. In this project, we focus on transliteration from Bulgarian, which is written with the Cyrillic alphabet, into English.

Packages: pytorch
